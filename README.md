# CPP_DynamicHeaps-Sorting
  Interesting program where I created my own heaps and sorting algorithms and tested their execution runtimes on different sized datasets. Used this in a analytical paper with the times recording using std::chrono. Taught me a lot about sorting and the thought process behind extrapolating a lower runtime program by thinking of data more atomically.
