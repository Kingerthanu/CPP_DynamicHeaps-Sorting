# CPP_DynamicHeaps-Sorting
  Program where I created my own heaps and sorting algorithms and tested their execution runtimes on different sized datasets. Used this in a analytical paper with the times recording using std::chrono.

  Taught me a lot about sorting and the thought process behind extrapolating a lower runtime program by thinking of data more atomically.
